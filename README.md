# Venn

![Lifecycle Archived](https://badgen.net/badge/Lifecycle/Archived/grey)

Venn is a flexible system for resource and capacity management for pools of
shared resources.

# Getting Started

## Installation

See the INSTALL file.

## Defining your Resource Domain

Venn specializes in managing overlapping pools of resources.

### Containers

Containers are logical groupings of providers and do not provide resources
themselves. It's best thought of as a tree, for example: a rack contains two
clusters and two filers.  The clusters contain host containers which have two
providers: compute and memory. The filers both provide I/O and contain logical
shares (which provide storage).

Containers have the table prefix "C\_".

```
             C_Rack
             /    \
            /      \
   C_Cluster       C_Filer
       |          /       \
       |         /         \
    C_Host    P_Share     P_IO
    /    \
   /      \
 P_CPU   P_Memory
```

### Providers

Providers provide countable or named resources that can be consumed. An example
of a countable resource is memory (RAM) and an example of a named resource is
an IP address or hostname.

### Assignment Group Type

An Assignment Group Type (AGT) is a collection of resources (containers and
providers) for a single object.  It uses a YAML-based definition to represent a
tree of resources similar to the diagram in the Containers section.

### Attributes

Attributes are used to "tag" resources, for example:

* Environments (dev, qa, prod, ...)
* Capability (ssd, 10g, ...)
* Owner (dba, IT, finance, ...)

## Configuration

Root config directory: etc/conf

### Providers and Containers

`etc/conf/providers/$name.yml`

The definition config file should start with the root container.

Containers have the following properties:

* name: name of the container
* display_name: friendly name of the container
* table: database table name
* +roles: roles to apply to the Result class
* +rs_roles: roles to apply to the ResultSet class
* primary_field: primary field/name of the provider
* primary_key: PK for the table, generally the primary_field
* indices: column indices to speed up queries
* columns: database columns (see DBIx::Class::ResultSource)

Containers may have containers underneath them, defined under:

* containers:
  * _container_name_: # literally the relationship name for the container (e.g. filer)

Example:

* containers:
  * filer:

Containers may have providers underneath them, defined under:

* subproviders:
  * _provider_name_: # literally the relationship name for the provider (e.g. memory)

Example:

* subproviders:
  * memory:

Providers ("subproviders" under containers) have the following properties:

* class: class name (e.g. Memory)
* name: class name (e.g. Memory)
* display_name: friendly name of the provider
* category: resource category (e.g. compute, memory, storage, io, etc.)
* unit: unit of measure for the resource (e.g. MHz, cores, MB, GB, IOps)
* overcommit_ratio: default overcommit ratio for this resource
* +roles: roles to apply to the Result class
* container_rel: the container relationship name that contains this resource
* table: database table name
* link_column: field name for the parent container, useful for minimal subprovider
* columns: database columns (see DBIx::Class::ResultSource)

As well as any DBIC supported joins, like: belongs_to, might_have, has_one,
many_to_many. Pass the equivalent parameters in YAML format to these.

### Attributes

`etc/conf/attributes.yml`

* table: database table name (can be generated)
* display_name: friendly name of the attribute
* primary_field: primary field/name of the attribute
* primary_key: PK for the table, generally the primary_field
* +rs_roles: additional DBIC ResultSet roles, used to add functionality to the
  attribute
* indices: column indices to speed up queries
* columns: database columns (see DBIx::Class::ResultSource)

### Assignment Group Types

`etc/conf/agt/$name.yml`

In order to build the relationships dynamically in Venn during placement, you
must define the Assignment Group Types as a tree, starting from one of the
providers.

* me: name of the base provider's relationship name (in the schema)
* description: used for display purposes
* provider_class: full class name for the base provider
* root_container_class: the container root of the tree's full class name
* root_container_alias: name of the top-level container (defined in the
  container itself)
* providers: hash of all providers in the AGT and a list of container
  relationships to "walk" to get from the base provider to this provider
* location: hash of all location parameters allowed in placement and the
  container that has the field
* provider_to_location_join: hash of all providers and the join parameters
  (using relationship names) needed to join from the base provider to the
  container with the location field
* join_clause: the join clause needed for the placement strategy to access all
  of the providers in the AGT
* place_format: sprintf-style format string that's returned after a replacement
* place_args: list of DBIC-style column names to satisfy the place_format
* overcommit: list of overcommits hashes in order of priority, the hash
  containing the overcommit name (e.g. overcommit_provider), and the field or
  subroutine name (e.g. '\&get_provider_overcommit') to call on the provider to
  get its overcommit ratio
* overcommit_join: like the other join clauses, this is the dbic join clause to
  access all of the overcommit values

## Adding Functionality (with Moose Roles)

`etc/conf/roles.yml`

Moose roles can be applied at runtime to certain parts of Venn using the
roles.yml config file.

# The Placement Engine

The Placement Engine is made up of several components:
* API
  * Request
    * Contains the assignment group type, requested resources, attributes, and
      flags necessary to perform the placement.
  * Result
    * Contains the metadata about the placement, including the request,
      strategy, state of the placement, placement candidate(s), location, debug
      info, assignment group, and commit group.
* Engine
  * Strategies: placement "algorithm"
  * Helpers: helper functions/attributes that can be reused across different
    strategies

## Capacity

The Capacity functions of the Placement Engine can be used to determine past
and present resource capacity based on Assignment Group Types.

## Placement

### Request

Sending a request to the Placement Engine can, depending on the options, result
in a successful placement and an Assignment Group, or a failure due to the lack
of capacity.

To place a set of resources, send a POST to /api/v1/place/$agt/$strategy where
$agt is a valid Assignment Group Type and $strategy is the name of a placement
strategy, like biggest_outlier or random.

The POST should be JSON containing:
* resources
  * required, hash of provider type to amount required
* attributes
  * optional, hash of attributes to values (can be lists of required values,
    they're ANDed)
* location
  * optional, hash of locations for placement, based on assignment group type
    locations
* friendly
  * optional, "friendly" name of the object being placed
* identifier
  * optional, force a specific UUID for the Assignment Group
* commit
  * optional, bool for committing the resources immediately
* additional
  * optional, hash of any additional/miscellaneous options used by strategies
* instances
  * optional, int of how many instances are needed for the placeement
* force_placement
  * optional, bool for forcing placement, ignoring capacity/attribute
    restraints
* manual_placement
  * optional, hash of provider type to placement location to force placement in
    a specific place

Example of a basic placement request:

    {
        resources: {
            cpu: 2,
            memory: 1024,
            disk: 20,
            io: 10
        },
        attributes: {
            environment: "dev",
            tags: [ "ssd", "10g" ]
        },
        location: {
            datacenter: "dc1"
        },
        friendly: "vm100"
    }

### Response

The response from the Placement Engine contains a lot of information:

* The incoming request

# Development

## Running a Test Server

$ `script/testserver.pl $port`

An example of running with the sqlite environment, with a prefix of /venn and
listening on port 8080:

$ `VENN_ENV=sqlite VENN_PREFIX=/venn ./testserver.pl 8080`

## Running the Test Suite

Running tests:

$ `prove -r t`

Running tests concurrently:

$ `prove -j$numthreads -r t`

Example: $ `prove -j4 -r t`

Running tests with database tracing:

$ `DBIC_TRACE=1 DBIC_TRACE_PROFILE=console prove -r t`

# CLI

The Venn CLI is a perl command line interface that can be used to interact with
the Venn API. It can be installed from a separate project: venn-cli.

# UI

The Venn UI is coming soon and will provide AngularJS services and directives to
easily make a custom website to view/manage capacity.

It will be distributed in a separate project: venn-ui.
